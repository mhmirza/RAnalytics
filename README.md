# RAnalytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Programming in R for Analytics**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020. The work done here involves: manipulating data objects, producing graphics, analyzing data using common statistical methods, and generating reproducible statistical reports. To view my course repository on GitHub, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/RAnalytics).

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Programming in R for Analytics, I wish to learn how to use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts. Moreover, I hope to gain an understanding of the functional challenges related to importing, exporting and manipulating data. In addition, I intend to garner skills required to produce statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data; generate basic graphics using standard functions; and produce more advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library. Finally, I wish to gain insights into performing common hypothesis tests, and running simple regression models to furnish statistical analyses in R Markdown/R Notebooks.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** "Sex-related differences: Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?"

The main question of interest was answered in the project through the following steps:

1) **Data processing and summarization:** Insightful graphical and tabular summaries of the data

2) **Methodology:** Dealing with missing values and topcoded variables; exploring trends and correlations; variable selection

3) **Findings:** Tabular summaries; graphical Summaries; regression and interpretation of coefficients; assessment of statistical significance

4) **Discussion:** Potential confounders; model fit limitations; confidence in results for policy makers
