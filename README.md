# RAnalytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Programming in R for Analytics**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020. The work done here involves: manipulating data objects, producing graphics, analyzing data using common statistical methods, and generating reproducible statistical reports.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Programming in R for Analytics, I wish to learn how to use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts. Moreover, I hope to gain an understanding of the functional challenges related to importing, exporting and manipulating data. In addition, I intend to garner skills required to produce statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data; generate basic graphics using standard functions; and produce more advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library. Finally, I wish to gain insights into performing common hypothesis tests, and running simple regression models to furnish statistical analyses in R Markdown/R Notebooks.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** The Symptom Checker ChatBot - The objective of our project is to create a Python Application that functions like a chatbot and takes user input (based on symptoms) via a series of questions to:

1) Obtain a list of diseases from reliable/vetted online sources (use of maximum three web sources based on reliability) most commonly associated with the symptoms shared by the user.

2) Allow the user to retrieve more information, such as causes, treatment, a list of over-the-counter medications to alleviate the symptoms, and nearby health facilities based on their location.

3) Provide a reference list of a panel of doctors or hospitals based on userâ€™s location for further review by the user.
